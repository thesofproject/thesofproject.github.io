SOF Driver Architecture
=======================

|SOF| can either operate as a standalone firmware or alongside a host OS
driver for configuration and control. The |SOF| OS driver is responsible for
loading firmware, loading configuration and managing firmware use cases.
Currently |SOF| has a driver for the Linux OS.

The |SOF| driver code is dual licensed GPLv2 and BSD and this means the user
can choose which licence they want to use (either BSD or GPLv2). The driver
stack is designed with maximum resuse so that large portions of it can be
taken and integrated into other OSs or RTOSs.

Linux Driver
------------

The Linux ASoC driver is upstream in the Linux kernel from v5.2 onwards. The
architecture for |SOF| is shown in the diagram below. The driver
architecture is split into four layers, like a protocol stack, each with a
different purpose.

#. **Machine driver.** The ASoC machine driver does all the
   machine/board audio hardware integration. It also glues the platform
   driver and drivers for any codec(s) together so they appear as a single
   ALSA sound card. |SOF| can reuse existing upstream machine drivers (as
   only the platform name needs to be changed) or can have bespoke machine
   drivers. *Linux OS specific - GPLv2 only.*

#. **Generic PCM Driver.** The PCM driver creates ALSA PCMs, DAPM, and
   kcontrols based on the topology data loaded at run time. The PCM driver
   also allocates buffers for DMA and registers with run time PM. It is
   architecture and platform generic code. Generic for all **platforms**,
   but OS specific - GPLv2 only.*

#. **Generic IPC driver.** The IPC driver is the messaging bridge
   between the host and DSP and defines the messaging ABI and protocol. It
   is architecture and platform generic code. *Generic OS - BSD or GPLv2.*

#. **DSP Platform Driver.** The platform driver is a platform specific
   driver that abstracts the low level platform DSP hardware into a common
   generic API that is used by the upper layers. This includes code that
   will initialize the DSP and boot the firmware. *Generic OS - BSD or GPLv2.*

	the diagram shows the mailbox/doorbell mechanism and the DSP.
	The Linux PCM and IPC drivers can be reused without modification on every
	platform. Runtime differentiation can be achived by regenerating
	topology data to match device use cases whilst static hardware
	differentiation is achieved via the machine driver and/or ACPI / Device
	Tree configuration.`
