Logger
######

Sof-logger is used to print logs delivered from FW dma_trace mechanism, by searching log
entries in ldc file generated by rimage. Every entry declared in FW is placed in elf output file (e.g. sof-apl) in 
.static_log_entries section in a form of struct defined in sof/src/include/sof/trace.h in sof fw repo.

Ldc file contains snd_sof_logs_header (defined in rmbox/logger_convert.c) 
following by .static_log_entries section incorporated from FW elf file (e.g. sof-apl).
snd_sof_logs_header contains basic information about .static_log_entries section
like base_address and data_length. Sof-logger works by reading entry parameters value and
entries addresses from FW dma_trace mechanism and searching suitable entry in ldc file
by its address.

Logger usage
************

Usage sof-logger <option(s)> <file(s)>

-h 					help
-l ldc_file			Specify the ldc file
-i in_file			Get traces from in_file, instead of the default "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace"
-o out_file 		Specify the output file, instead of default stdout
-t					Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace", instead of the default "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace"
-p					Get traces from stdin, instead of the default "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace"
-c					Set timestamp clock in MHz
-e					Enable checking firmware version with default verification file "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_version"
-v ver_file 		Enable checking firmware version with ver_file file, instead of default: "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_version"
-s					Take a snapshot of state


Examples:

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file, verifies fw_version with
  "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_version" and prints logs to stdout 
 
.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -e
	
- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file, verifies fw_version with
  ver_file file and prints logs to stdout

.. code-block:: bash
  
   sof-logger -l ldc_file -v ver_file

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file and prints logs to stdout

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file and prints logs to
  out_file file

.. code-block:: bash
  
   sof-logger -l ldc_file -o out_file

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace" file and prints logs to stdout

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -t

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace" file and prints logs to 
  out_file file

.. code-block:: bash
 
   sof-logger -l ldc_file -t -o out_file

- Get traces from stdin and prints logs to stdout

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -p

- Get traces from stdin and prints logs to out_file file

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -p -o out_file

- Get traces from trace_dump file and prints logs to stdout

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump

- Get traces from trace_dump file and prints logs to out_file file

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump -o out_file

- c flag is intented for defining clock value (in MHz) used to format log 
  timestamps. By default clock value is set to 19.2 (MHz). Below example
  set clock value to 19.9 (MHz).

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump -o out_file -c 19.9
