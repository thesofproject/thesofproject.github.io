SOF code owners
###############

Each repository defines its own CODE_OWNER file, which identifies key
contributors and experts in each area of the SOF project.

Code owners will be notified of each change to their respective
domains, and are encouraged to approve or provide feedback on
contributions being reviewed.

Each repository in the SOF project may define their own rules, but the
general expectation is that Pull Requests are approved by 2 or more
code owners, maintainers or admin.
