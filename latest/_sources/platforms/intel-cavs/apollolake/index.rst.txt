Intel Apollo Lake
#################

Intel Apollo Lake (APL) platform is built on cAVS 1.5 HW and uses Xtensa DSP
architecture.

The only Apollo Lake commercially-available platform is the Up Squared
board, which uses a BIOS compatible with SOF. Other platforms can be
supported but require a BIOS change.

Chromebooks based on Gemini Lake support SOF directly in both the
official images and in developer mode.
