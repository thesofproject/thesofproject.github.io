Intel Baytrail/CherryTrail
##########################

Intel Baytrail platform is based on an Atom CPU and a Tensilica HiFi2
EP DSP. It relies on both internal memory and caches to access DDR
memory. The Baytrail processor relies on a 25 MHz oscillator.

Supported commercially-available platforms include the MinnowBoard
Turbot, tablets and laptops built for Windows (SOF requires a Linux
installation).

The Cherrytrail platform is similar to Baytrail but it relies on a
19.2 MHz osciilator. Supported commercially-available platforms
include the Up board and devices built for Windows (SOF requires a
Linux installation).

Baytrail and Cherrytrail Chromebooks can support SOF but the official
images are still based on the closed-source firmware solution.
