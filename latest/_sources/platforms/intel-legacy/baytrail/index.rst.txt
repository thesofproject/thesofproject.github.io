Intel Bay Trail / Cherry Trail
##############################

Intel Bay Trail platform is based on an Atom CPU and a Tensilica HiFi2
EP DSP. It relies on both internal memory and caches to access DDR
memory. The Bay Trail processor relies on a 25 MHz oscillator.

Supported commercially-available platforms include the MinnowBoard
Turbot, tablets and laptops built for Windows (SOF requires a Linux
installation).

The Cherry Trail platform is similar to Bay Trail but it relies on a
19.2 MHz osciilator. Supported commercially-available platforms
include the Up board and devices built for Windows (SOF requires a
Linux installation).

Bay Trail and Cherry Trail Chromebooks can support SOF but the official
images are still based on the closed-source firmware solution.
