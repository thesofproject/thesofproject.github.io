Intel Broadwell
###############

Intel Broadwell platform is based on an core CPU and a Tensilica HiFi2
EP DSP integrated in the PCH. It relies only on internal memory (no
caches).

Supported commercially-available platforms are limited. The SOF team
is only aware of the Chromebook Pixel 2015 (code name "samus") and the
Dell XPS.
