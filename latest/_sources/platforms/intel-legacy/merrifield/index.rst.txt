Intel Merrifield
################

Intel Merrifield platform is based on an Atom CPU and a Tensilica HiFi2
EP DSP. It is very similar to Baytrail but uses a PCI-based
enumeration and has a clocking structure similar to Cherrytrail.

This platform is no longer commercially available, but the Edison
platform is supported by the open-source community.
